The majority of our interactions on the Internet occur on the World Wide Web and our interface to the content on the Web are documents structured with HTML and styled with CSS. Today we'll look at the purpose and use of these technologies. We'll assume some basic understanding so that we can dive deeper into the details of how to use the different features of these two technologies to create the foundation of every single web app you'll ever build.

After this lesson, you'll be familiar with:

1. The purpose and semantics of HTML
